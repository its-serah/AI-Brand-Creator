# Brand Generator System Design Boilerplate

A comprehensive collection of system design approaches for building an AI-powered Brand Creator platform. This repository provides four different architectural patterns, each optimized for different use cases, scales, and operational requirements.

## System Overview

The AI Brand Creator generates complete brand kits including logos, color palettes, fonts, and design rationale using:

- **SDXL + LoRA models** for logo generation
- **ControlNet** for design constraints
- **Neo4j/Neptune** for Brand Knowledge Graph (BKG)
- **FastAPI** for REST endpoints
- **Queue systems** for async processing
- **S3** for asset storage
- **WCAG compliance** checks
- **Bilingual rationale** generation

## Architecture Options Comparison

| Architecture | Best For | Complexity | Cost | Scale |
|-------------|----------|------------|------|-------|
| [MVP Monolith](./01-mvp-monolith/) | Hackathons, demos, early pilots | Low | Low | Small |
| [Queue-Centric Modular](./02-queue-centric-modular/) | First production users (100-1K) | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| [Serverless-First](./03-serverless-first/) | Spiky traffic, tight budget | Medium | Variable | High |
| [Microservices + Streaming](./04-microservices-streaming/) | Continuous experiments at scale | High | High | Very High |

## Quick Start Guide


### Common Setup Requirements

All architectures require:
- GPU access for SDXL inference
- Graph database (Neo4j or Neptune)
- Object storage (S3 or compatible)
- Container runtime (Docker)

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Model Management
- **SDXL + LoRA**: Industry-specific fine-tuned weights
- **ControlNet**: Palette and shape constraints
- **Triton/ONNX**: Runtime optimization where possible

### Brand Knowledge Graph (BKG)
- Start with Neo4j for faster development
- Consider Neptune for serverless integration
- Graph queries for palette/font recommendations

### Quality Assurance
- Automated WCAG contrast checks
- Bilingual font script validation
- Golden test kits per industry
- Prompt/version pinning for reproducibility

### Security & Compliance
- Signed URLs for asset access
- Per-job IAM policies
- Audit logs for prompts and outputs
- Data retention policies

## Performance Characteristics

| Metric | MVP Monolith | Queue-Centric | Serverless | Microservices |
|--------|--------------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| **Startup Time** | Fast | Medium | Slow (cold starts) | Medium |
| **Throughput** | Low-Medium | High | Variable | Very High |
| **Latency** | Low | Medium | High (initial) | Low |
| **Fault Tolerance** | Low | Medium | High | Very High |
| **Operational Complexity** | Low | Medium | Medium | High |

## Development Workflow

Each architecture includes:
- Development environment setup
- Testing strategies
- CI/CD pipelines
- Monitoring configurations
- Deployment guides

## Migration Path Options

Starting simple and evolving:
1. **MVP Monolith** to **Queue-Centric Modular** (when hitting resource limits)
2. **Queue-Centric** to **Serverless** (for cost optimization)
3. **Any** to **Microservices** (for maximum flexibility and scale)
