# AI Brand Creator

A comprehensive AI-powered brand generation platform with multiple architectural approaches. This repository provides four production-ready system designs, each optimized for different use cases, scales, and operational requirements.

Generate complete brand kits including logos, color palettes, fonts, and design rationale using SDXL models, ControlNet, and intelligent prompt engineering.

## System Overview

The AI Brand Creator generates complete brand kits including logos, color palettes, fonts, and design rationale using:

- **SDXL + LoRA models** for logo generation
- **ControlNet** for design constraints
- **Neo4j/Neptune** for Brand Knowledge Graph (BKG)
- **FastAPI** for REST endpoints
- **Queue systems** for async processing
- **S3** for asset storage
- **WCAG compliance** checks
- **Bilingual rationale** generation

## Architecture Options Comparison

| Architecture | Best For | Complexity | Cost | Scale | GCP Support |
|-------------|----------|------------|------|-------|-------------|
| [MVP Monolith](./architectures/mvp-monolith/) | Demos, hackathons, prototypes | Low | Low | Small | Yes |
| [Queue-Centric](./architectures/queue-centric/) | Production (100-1K users) | Medium | Medium | Medium | Yes |
| [Serverless](./architectures/serverless/) | Variable traffic, cost optimization | Medium | Variable | High | Yes |
| [Microservices](./architectures/microservices/) | Enterprise scale, continuous deployment | High | High | Very High | Yes |

## Quick Start Guide


### Common Setup Requirements

All architectures require:
- GPU access for SDXL inference
- Graph database (Neo4j or Neptune)
- Object storage (S3 or compatible)
- Container runtime (Docker)

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Model Management
- **SDXL + LoRA**: Industry-specific fine-tuned weights
- **ControlNet**: Palette and shape constraints
- **Triton/ONNX**: Runtime optimization where possible

### Brand Knowledge Graph (BKG)
- Start with Neo4j for faster development
- Consider Neptune for serverless integration
- Graph queries for palette/font recommendations

### Quality Assurance
- Automated WCAG contrast checks
- Bilingual font script validation
- Golden test kits per industry
- Prompt/version pinning for reproducibility

### Security & Compliance
- Signed URLs for asset access
- Per-job IAM policies
- Audit logs for prompts and outputs
- Data retention policies

## Performance Characteristics

| Metric | MVP Monolith | Queue-Centric | Serverless | Microservices |
|--------|--------------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| **Startup Time** | Fast | Medium | Slow (cold starts) | Medium |
| **Throughput** | Low-Medium | High | Variable | Very High |
| **Latency** | Low | Medium | High (initial) | Low |
| **Fault Tolerance** | Low | Medium | High | Very High |
| **Operational Complexity** | Low | Medium | Medium | High |

## Development Workflow

Each architecture includes:
- Development environment setup
- Testing strategies
- CI/CD pipelines
- Monitoring configurations
- Deployment guides

## Migration Path Options

Starting simple and evolving:
1. **MVP Monolith** to **Queue-Centric Modular** (when hitting resource limits)
2. **Queue-Centric** to **Serverless** (for cost optimization)
3. **Any** to **Microservices** (for maximum flexibility and scale)
