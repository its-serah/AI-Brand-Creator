## API Endpoints

### Brand Generation
- `POST /api/v1/brand/generate` - Generate complete brand identity
- `GET /api/v1/brand/status/{job_id}` - Check generation job status

### Configuration Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/brand/styles` - Available logo styles
- `GET /api/v1/brand/industries` - Supported industries
- `GET /api/v1/brand/personalities` - Brand personality traits
- `GET /api/v1/brand/color-schemes` - Available color schemes
- `GET /api/v1/brand/examples` - Example brand configurations

### System Health
- `GET /api/health/` - Basic health status
- `GET /api/health/ready` - Readiness check for deployment
- `GET /api/health/live` - Liveness check for monitoring

## AI Model Integration Points

The service architecture includes placeholder implementations for AI model integration:

### Logo Generation
Located in `brand_service.py`, lines 164-207. Replace placeholder logic with your SDXL + LoRA pipeline integration.

### Brand Knowledge Graph
Located in `brand_service.py`, lines 238-295. Integrate with your Neo4j or Neptune database for color and typography recommendations.

### Image Enhancement
Located in `brand_service.py`, lines 374-409. Connect your upscaling and image-to-image enhancement models.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The application uses environment-based configuration. Key settings include:
- Neo4j database connection parameters
- S3 storage configuration
- GPU device settings
- Model cache directories

### Customization Options
- Color scheme modification via CSS variables
- Form field extensions through model updates
- API endpoint customization through route configuration

## Development

### Local Development
```bash
python server.py
```
The server runs with auto-reload enabled for development convenience.

### API Testing
Use the interactive documentation at `/docs` or test endpoints directly:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/brand/generate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @example_request.json
```

### Frontend Development
Frontend assets are served statically during development. Modify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files directly for rapid iteration.

## Browser Compatibility

The frontend is compatible with modern browsers including:
- Chrome 88 and later
- Firefox 84 and later
- Safari 14 and later
- Edge 88 and later

## Accessibility

The interface follows web accessibility guidelines:
- Semantic HTML structure
- WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Focus management and ARIA labels

## Production Considerations

### Deployment
- Configure proper environment variables for production
- Set up SSL/TLS termination
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Configure CORS policies appropriately

### Security
- API rate limiting implementation
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure file upload handling
- Authentication and authorization integration

### Performance
- Static asset optimization
- API response caching strategies
- Background job processing for long-running tasks
- Database connection pooling

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation provides a foundation for additional features:
- User authentication and account management
- Brand template library and sharing
- Advanced customization options
- Export functionality for various file formats
- Integration with external design tools

## Technical Notes

The service uses modern Python async/await patterns for optimal performance. The frontend employs vanilla JavaScript to minimize dependencies while maintaining full functionality. The modular architecture supports easy extension and modification for specific requirements.

For detailed implementation information, refer to the inline code documentation and API schema definitions available through the interactive documentation interface.
